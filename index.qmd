### About

I am a PhD student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, specializing in health economics. My research focuses on Medicaid, social safety net programs, and their interactions. Before graduate school, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Tobin Center for Economic Policy, where I researched Medicaid access, quality of care, and the impact of social programs on Medicaid enrollees.
