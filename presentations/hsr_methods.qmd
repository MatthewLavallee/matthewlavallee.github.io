## Background

- Medicaid
  + Primary insurer of low-income populations.
  + Largest insurer in the US, covers 74 million people.
  + No cost sharing, meaning no disincentive to use of care.
  + Like all of health care, increasing spending.

- Medicaid Managed Care (MMC)
  + Allows a private org to coordinate care for a flat payment, and keep whatever profit they can turn (i.e., $\text{State Payment}_{im}-\text{Spending}_{im}$).
  + Now is responsible for 70% of Medicaid beneficaries.

## Concerns about networks
  
## Concerns about networks

- Too narrow: access
  + 60% of Medicaid-accepting Primary Care providers report difficulty obtaining specialty care visits for patients.
  + Particularly worried about cardiologist access due to lower reimbursement.
  

## Concerns about networks

- Too narrow: access
  + 60% of Medicaid-accepting Primary Care providers report difficulty obtaining specialty care visits for patients.
  
- Too broad: spending
  + Worry that marginal provider may deliver more low-value care or unnecessary services, driving spending.

## Setting & data
- Tennessee administrative claims data (2010-2017)
  + Have not expanded, so no massive shifts in enrollment or payment.
  + Includes healthcare information on care provided.
  + Includes enrollment information on enrollee.
  + MMC plan NPI rosters.
- National Plan Provider Enumeration System NPI Registry
  + Allows us to flag specialists.
- All enrollees must be in MMC
  + Enrollees who do not make a choice are auto-assigned (AA).
  + AA algorithm prioritizes family continuity and prior plan continuity.
  + A subset, those qualifying due to SSDI, are always conditionally randomized (conditional on: unit of randomization and county).

## Variable construction

- Three measures of spending
  + Spending includes total spending, outpatient spending, inpatient spending, and ED spending.

- A single treatment variable
  + Number of (nonghost) cardiologists per 1,000 enrollees in a county-plan-year.

- Set of controls
  + Randomization variables (UoR, and county, $\omega$).
  + Plan FE.
  + PCP network breadth.
  
## Study population

## Spending is zero-inflated

</div>

## Methods

- Intent-to-treat
  + $y_i=\alpha+\beta_1\text{assigned card breadth}+\beta_2\text{assigned pcp breadth}+\beta_3\text{assigned plan}+\lambda\omega+\varepsilon_i$
  + High compliance, 97% of the sample stays in their assigned plan and assigned county.

- Two-part models
  + Simple specification, $\text{assigned breadth}$ and $\omega$.
  + Two parts theory, one part prediction.
  
## Choice for second part

## Discussion and limitations

- Imprecise nulls don't make a convincing argument.
- Unclear how flexible $\omega$ specification is, and if it can carry over to two-part models.
  + More convincing as a propensity score?
  + Falsification tests.

- Standard errors are likely wrong.
