# About 

I am a Research Associate at Boston College studying disparities in health care and the Social Safety Net in the United States. Previously, I spent two years as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow with [Yale's Tobin Center of Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/tobin-predoctoral-fellows) and [Yale's School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/).

I earned my BA in Economics & Mathematics from Hampshire College in 2020. Feel free to view my [CV](./files/Lavallee_Matthew_CV.pdf).
