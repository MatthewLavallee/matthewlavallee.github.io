I am currently a pre-doctoral fellow with the Tobin Center for Economic Policy and Yale School of Public Health researching topics at the intersection of health economics and health policy. I am interesting in pursuing a PhD with a focus on policy, health, and labor.

I graduated with a BA in Economics & Mathematics from Hampshire College in 2020.
