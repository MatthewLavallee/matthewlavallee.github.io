### About

I am PhD student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, training to become a health economist. My research interests include Medicaid, the social safety net, and how programs interact. Before graduate school, I worked as a Tobin Center / Economics Pre-Doctoral Fellow researching access to care and quality of care in Medicaid, and how social programs shape care within Medicaid.
