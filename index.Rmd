I'm a young researcher looking to enter a career focused on empirical policy evaluation. My research interests include: healthcare, welfare policy, and labor markets.

I graduated from Hampshire College in 2020, where I completed a BA in Economics and Mathematics. I'm currently working as a [Tobin Predoctoral Fellow](https://tobin.yale.edu/tobin-predoctoral-fellows) for the Yale School of Public Health.
