# About Me

I am a PhD student in Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School of Public Health studying how safety net programs interact to shape health. Previously, I spent two years as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow with [Yale's Tobin Center of Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/tobin-predoctoral-fellows) and [Yale's School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/) working on access and quality of care in Medicaid.

I earned my BA in Economics & Mathematics from Hampshire College in 2020. You can view my CV [here](./files/CV/cv2.pdf).
