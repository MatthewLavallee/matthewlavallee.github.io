abstract: IMPORTANCE Administrative records indicate that more than half of the 80 million Medicaid enrollees identify as belonging to a racial and ethnic minority group. Despite this, disparities within the Medicaid program remain understudied. For example, we know of no studies examining racial differences in Medicaid spending, a potential measure of how equitably state resources are allocated.
OBJECTIVES To examine whether and to what extent there are differences in health care spending
and utilization between Black and White enrollees in Medicaid.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used calendar year 2016
administrative data from 3 state Medicaid programs and included 1 966 689 Black and White
Medicaid enrollees. Analyses were performed between January 28, 2021, and October 18, 2021.
EXPOSURES Self-reported race.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates and racial differences in health care spending and
utilization (including Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS] access measures).
RESULTS Of 1 966 689 Medicaid adults and children (mean [SD] age, 20.3 [17.1] years; 1 119 136
[56.9%] female), 867 183 (44.1%) self-identified as non-Hispanic Black and 1 099 506 (55.9%) selfidentified as non-Hispanic White. Results were adjusted for age, sex, Medicaid eligibility category, zip
code, health status, and usual source of care. On average, annual spending on Black adult (19 years
or older) Medicaid enrollees was $317 (95% CI, $259-$375) lower than White enrollees, a 6%
difference. Among children (18 years or younger), annual spending on Black enrollees was $256
(14%) lower (95% CI, $222-$290). Adult Black enrollees also had 19.3 (95% CI, 16.78-21.84), or 4%,
fewer primary care encounters per 100 enrollees per year compared with White enrollees. Among
children, the differences in primary care utilization were larger: Black enrollees had 90.1 (95% CI,
88.2-91.8) fewer primary care encounters per 100 enrollees per year compared with White enrollees,
a 23% difference. Black enrollees had lower utilization of most other services, including high-value
prescription drugs, but higher emergency department use and rates of HEDIS preventive screenings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of US Medicaid enrollees in 3 states,
Black enrollees generated lower spending and used fewer services, including primary care and
recommended care for acute and chronic conditions, but had substantially higher emergency
department use. While Black enrollees had higher rates of HEDIS preventive screenings, ensuring
equitable access to all services in Medicaid must remain a national priority
